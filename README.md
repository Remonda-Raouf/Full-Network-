🔐 Network Security Project – Cisco Packet Tracer
📌 Description

This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a secure enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The setup integrates routing, authentication, logging, and advanced security mechanisms to ensure reliability and protection.

🚀 Features

Subnetting & IP Addressing

Secure device access (Passwords & SSH)

Dynamic routing with OSPF

Centralized logging with Syslog

Time synchronization via NTP

AAA authentication (TACACS+ & RADIUS)

Traffic control with ACLs

Advanced security using Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZPF)

Encrypted remote connectivity via VPN

🛠 Technologies Used

Cisco Packet Tracer

Routing Protocols (OSPF)

Network Security (ACLs, SSH, AAA, ZPF, VPN)

Network Services (Syslog, NTP)

📜 Usage

Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Access router CLI and verify configurations:

enable

show running-config

Test basic connectivity between PCs using ping.

Validate routing: show ip route ospf.

Test secure access via SSH login.

Check applied ACL and ZPF policies to ensure traffic filtering.

🎯 Suggested Improvements

Integration with IDS/IPS for intrusion detection.

Persistent log storage for auditing.

Migration to GNS3 or real Cisco hardware for production-grade testing.
